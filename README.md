# WordleTerminal
A simple terminal game inspired by the NY times game Wordle. 

To play, clone the repository, and open in VS Code. Ensure colorama is installed by running: 
`pip3 install colorama`


Ensure that the path in wordle.sh matches the one where python3 is installed on your machine. Then run:

`sh wordle.sh`

Type your word guesses in the command prompt, and try your best to guess the wordle!
